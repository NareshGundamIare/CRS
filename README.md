Currency recognition systems based on image processing have received a lot of interest in recent years 
because of their capacity to automate the identification and authentication of banknotes. These systems 
use powerful image processing techniques and algorithms to analyze the visual properties of banknote 
pictures and categorize them based on their denominations. The major goal of this project is to create a 
money identification system capable of reliably and speedily recognizing various types of banknotes. The 
system outputs the recognized denomination and authentication findings, which may be used for a variety 
of applications such as cash sorting, financial record keeping, and automated cash handling systems. It 
will assist users in recognizing currency data such as Currency Value, Currency Name, and the value in INR, 
EUR, and US Dollar. It is based on the basic qualities of currency notes, such as size, color, or printed 
text, and it also relies on different currency notes within the same nation. We studied the denominations 
of the INDIAN RUPEE and the US DOLLAR, the two most often used currencies in our sector. This device is 
accurate and can swiftly recognize money notes.
